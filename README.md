# ASCOM.RaspberryPiMTP.Camera

This is a work-in-progress ASCOM driver for the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera with Raspberry Pi Zero. It's designed to work with my work-in-progress MTP firmware (https://github.com/IanCassTwo/uMTP-Responder) to make the Raspberry Pi appear to Windows as a USB DSLR camera running the PTP/MTP protocol. Once finished, this should be a truly plug and play solution.
